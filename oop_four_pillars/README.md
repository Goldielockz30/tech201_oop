# OOP 

### What is OOP

Object-Oriented Programming  is the most popular programming paradigm, structured around objects, objects are defined as data fields which have unique attributes and behaviour, they contain data in the form of attributes and code it the form of methods.
The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function

- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism


# Explaining Four Pillars of OOP
There are four basic principles for writing clean and concise code.

- Abstraction  
Abstraction keeping the process simple by keeping the unnecessary internal details of the code hidden from the user.
This reduces the complexity of the code, so that we can focus on what is important.  


- Inheritance  
 The capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
 Where there is a parent class and a child class, the child class inherits the properties and methods of the parent class.   


- Encapsulation  
This is the process of making data private by wrapping data and its methods in a unit, so that it cannot be accessed or modified outside of that unit, this is done by making variables inside a class private using a double underscore.   


- Polymorphism  
Polymorphism means many forms, this means that you can have one function or object that can be used in different ways. The child class methods can override the methods in the parent class when called with the child class object. This is useful if we need to change the method to fit the needs of the child class while still having access to the parent class method.  


# What are the benefits of using OOP?

- Re-usability
- Data redundancy
- Code Maintenance
- Security
- Design Benefits
- Better productivity
- Easy Troubleshooting
- Polymorphism Flexibility
- Problem Solving

# What are Lambda Functions?  
A lambda is an anonymous function, lambdas don't have names, we define a lambda in Python using the keyword lambda followed by one or more arguments, a colon () and a single expression. e.g.  
lambda <argument(s)> : <expression>

The core purpose of using this concept is it makes the creation of functions easy.


# Where can Lambda functions be useful?

- They reduce the number of lines of code in comparison to normal python functions.  


- They are generally used when a function is only needed for a short period of time.  


- With lambda function, you can define and call it immediately at the end of definition.
